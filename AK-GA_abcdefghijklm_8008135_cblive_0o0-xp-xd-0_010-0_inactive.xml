    <JobTitle>Assistant Wrestling with Social Studies</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Wrestling with Social Studies position at Springdale High is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Assistant Wrestling with Social Studies works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program.

The Sprints Coach at Regis Jesuit High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Sprints Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department.

Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Regis Jesuit High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Regis Jesuit High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Sprints Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Sprints Coach role at Regis Jesuit High School.

That means the MS Asst Wrestling Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the MS Asst Wrestling Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at South Routt School District RE-3. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>High School Assistant Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The High School Assistant Track Coach position at Bayfield School District is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the High School Assistant Track Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The High School Assistant Track Coach at Bayfield School District sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Bayfield School District, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The High School Assistant Track Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The High School Assistant Track Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the High School Assistant Track Coach position at Bayfield School District is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>High School Assistant Volleyball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The High School Assistant Volleyball Coach position at Bayfield School District provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the High School Assistant Volleyball Coach prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Bayfield School District, the High School Assistant Volleyball Coach works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The High School Assistant Volleyball Coach encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the High School Assistant Volleyball Coach at Bayfield School District is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>Assistant Coach - Girls Basketball</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach - Girls Basketball position at Valley High School is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Assistant Coach - Girls Basketball works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Assistant Coach - Girls Basketball at Valley High School sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Valley High School, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Assistant Coach - Girls Basketball encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Assistant Coach - Girls Basketball is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Assistant Coach - Girls Basketball position at Valley High School is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Coach - Girls Soccer</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach - Girls Soccer position at Valley High School provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the Assistant Coach - Girls Soccer prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Valley High School, the Assistant Coach - Girls Soccer works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The Assistant Coach - Girls Soccer encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the Assistant Coach - Girls Soccer at Valley High School is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobTitle>ASSISTANT BOYS BASKETBALL COACH</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The ASSISTANT BOYS BASKETBALL COACH role at PLATTE CANYON HIGH SCHOOL is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come. The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

From a competitive standpoint, the ASSISTANT BOYS BASKETBALL COACH is responsible for developing seasonal plans that align practice content, conditioning work, and game preparation. This includes designing practice segments that progress from individual fundamentals to full‑team tactical execution. The coach should be comfortable breaking down film, identifying areas for improvement, and communicating game plans in a way that athletes can understand and apply under pressure.

Equally important is the culture created by the coach. At PLATTE CANYON HIGH SCHOOL, teams are expected to demonstrate sportsmanship, respect, and unity. The ASSISTANT BOYS BASKETBALL COACH sets standards for effort in practice, behavior in the classroom, and conduct in the community. That might involve establishing team guidelines, leading discussions about values, and recognizing athletes who demonstrate leadership or growth in those areas. The goal is to build a program where success is measured not just by wins and losses but by the quality of the experience for everyone involved.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school. The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones. Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At PLATTE CANYON HIGH SCHOOL, the ASSISTANT BOYS BASKETBALL COACH is viewed as part of the educational team.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork. Safety protocols, including emergency action planning and injury‑reporting procedures, must be consistently followed.

Overall, the ASSISTANT BOYS BASKETBALL COACH at PLATTE CANYON HIGH SCHOOL is best suited for a coach who is excited about teaching, willing to collaborate with colleagues, and prepared to invest in the growth of student‑athletes over multiple seasons.

The Head Swim/Dive Coach at West Valley High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Head Swim/Dive Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At West Valley High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Head Swim/Dive Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Head Swim/Dive Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at West Valley High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent West Valley High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Head Swim/Dive Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Head Swim/Dive Coach role at West Valley High School.

This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment.

    <JobDescription>
The Athletic Coach at Widefield School District 3 is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Athletic Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Widefield School District 3 reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Athletic Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

That means the Athletic Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Athletic Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program.

    <JobTitle>Head Girls Volleyball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Girls Volleyball Coach role at Ponderosa High School is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come. The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The Athletic Coach encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the Athletic Coach at Widefield D3 is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.
