    <JobDescription>
The Elementary School Athletic Coach role at West Side emphasizes collaboration, consistency, and long‑term program development. This position is ideal for a coach who enjoys working as part of a broader athletic staff and who values building connections across grade levels and teams. The goal is to help create a smooth pathway for student‑athletes as they progress, while maintaining a recognizable identity and standard of excellence for the program.

In practical terms, the Elementary School Athletic Coach coordinates closely with the athletic director and fellow coaches to align terminology, teaching priorities, and expectations. This might involve participating in coaching meetings, sharing practice plans, and adapting approaches so that athletes experience similar structures and messages at each level. At West Side, the program is strongest when coaches communicate and support one another.

The coach works to balance repetition with variety, ensuring that key fundamentals are constantly reinforced while athletes also experience new challenges. The Elementary School Athletic Coach reviews performance with the team, helping athletes learn how to analyze both successes and mistakes in a constructive way.

This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

After competitions, the Assistant Wrestling Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Assistant Wrestling Coach role at Auburn High School.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Boys Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Boys Track Coach at Plainfield East High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Boys Track Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Plainfield East High School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Boys Track Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Boys Track Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Boys Track Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Plainfield East High School. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Assistant Girls Track Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program.

The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies.

The Head Girls Track Coach position at Plainfield South High School provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

    <JobTitle>Special Olympics Coordinator</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Special Olympics Coordinator at Lake Zurich High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Special Olympics Coordinator is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Lake Zurich High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Special Olympics Coordinator helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Special Olympics Coordinator works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Lake Zurich High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Lake Zurich High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Special Olympics Coordinator reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Special Olympics Coordinator role at Lake Zurich High School.

This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment.

    <JobTitle>Head Football Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Football Coach position at Knox College is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Head Football Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Head Football Coach at Knox College sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Knox College, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Head Football Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Head Football Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Head Football Coach position at Knox College is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At WEEKS MIDDLE, the MS Head Boys Track Coach (Stipend) - Weeks works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility.

Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the MS Head Boys Track Coach (Stipend) - Weeks at WEEKS MIDDLE is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season.

    <JobTitle>EMS Track and Field Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The EMS Track and Field Coach position at East Middle School is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the EMS Track and Field Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The EMS Track and Field Coach at East Middle School sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At East Middle School, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The EMS Track and Field Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The EMS Track and Field Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the EMS Track and Field Coach position at East Middle School is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

After competitions, the Softball Assistant Coach (3 Positions) reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Softball Assistant Coach (3 Positions) role at Thunder Ridge High School.

At Twin Falls High School, the program is strongest when coaches communicate and support one another.

Day‑to‑day responsibilities include designing practices that teach core skills, reinforcing team concepts, and preparing athletes for competition. The coach works to balance repetition with variety, ensuring that key fundamentals are constantly reinforced while athletes also experience new challenges. The Assistant Track Coach reviews performance with the team, helping athletes learn how to analyze both successes and mistakes in a constructive way.

The role extends into community and family engagement. Coaches represent Twin Falls High School at games, parent meetings, and potential youth outreach events. The Assistant Track Coach may help host clinics or camps, encourage younger students to try the sport, and provide information about expectations to families who are new to the program. A welcoming, organized presence can greatly influence how the program is perceived.

Athlete support is ongoing. The Assistant Track Coach monitors team morale, assists students in managing the demands of school and sport, and reinforces the importance of rest, nutrition, and healthy habits. The coach keeps the focus on sustainable growth rather than shortcuts, emphasizing that consistent effort over time leads to meaningful improvement.

Administrative tasks such as roster management, schedule communication, and equipment oversight are also part of the position. The Assistant Track Coach must handle these responsibilities reliably, as they are essential to maintaining a well‑run program. Coaches who enjoy seeing the big picture, who are willing to share ideas, and who care about the experience of every athlete will thrive in this role at Twin Falls High School.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>Junior High Assistant Wrestling Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Junior High Assistant Wrestling Coach at Brett Clark is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Junior High Assistant Wrestling Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Brett Clark reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Junior High Assistant Wrestling Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Junior High Assistant Wrestling Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

    <JobTitle>7th Grade Head Boys Basketball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The 7th Grade Head Boys Basketball Coach role at Andre Kelly is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come. The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

The Football Assistant Coach role at Niles Township Comm. H.S. D is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes.

The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

From a competitive standpoint, the Football Assistant Coach is responsible for developing seasonal plans that align practice content, conditioning work, and game preparation.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school.

Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At Niles Township Comm. H.S.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork.

The coach serves as a daily presence in the lives of student‑athletes, modeling the type of attitude and work ethic that leads to both athletic and personal growth.

At the core of the job is teaching. The Assistant Director Sports Performance is responsible for breaking down complex skills into manageable steps, offering demonstrations, and creating drills that allow athletes to practice safely and effectively. Practices should be organized around clear objectives, with time built in for warm‑up, instruction, repetition, and review. The coach gives frequent feedback, adjusts activities based on what athletes need, and encourages questions so that students remain engaged in their learning.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At Northern Illinois University, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected. That means setting guidelines that prevent negative behavior, addressing conflicts quickly and fairly, and celebrating contributions from both starters and role players. The Assistant Director Sports Performance encourages athletes to support one another, communicate openly, and take pride in representing their school with class.

Beyond the field, court, track, or pool, the coach collaborates with school staff to support student‑athletes as whole people. That includes reinforcing academic expectations, respecting school policies, and helping students manage the demands of both athletics and coursework. Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Assistant Director Sports Performance also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning. The coach is expected to stay current with best practices in training, injury prevention, and sport‑specific strategy, and to maintain any certifications required by the district or state association.

For individuals who enjoy working with young people, who believe in the value of school‑based athletics, and who are prepared to invest time in building a healthy team culture, the Assistant Director Sports Performance role at Northern Illinois University is a meaningful and impactful opportunity.</JobDescription>

    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Volunteer Golf Coach (Girls) position at Kris Klingele provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Kris Klingele, the Assistant Volunteer Golf Coach (Girls) works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility.

At its core, the Assistant Volunteer Golf Coach (Girls) at Kris Klingele is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobTitle>Girls Lacrosse JV Assistant Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Girls Lacrosse JV Assistant Coach at Tilmon Clark is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Girls Lacrosse JV Assistant Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Tilmon Clark reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Girls Lacrosse JV Assistant Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Girls Lacrosse JV Assistant Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Girls Lacrosse JV Assistant Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Tilmon Clark. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

The 7th Head Football Coach position at John Corcoran provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

At its core, the 7th Head Football Coach at John Corcoran is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach at Metropolitan S.D. of Washington Township is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the Assistant Coach manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The position carries a strong responsibility for modeling behavior. At Metropolitan S.D. of Washington Township, coaches are role models whether they are on the sideline, traveling with the team, or speaking with families. The Assistant Coach demonstrates composure, fairness, and respect, even in emotionally charged situations. Athletes observe and imitate these behaviors, so the coach’s example has a direct impact on team culture.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community. The coach collaborates with staff members, responds to communication from parents and guardians, and participates in department or school events as appropriate. Being visible and approachable helps families feel confident that their children are in a safe, supportive program.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation. The Assistant Coach follows all district and league regulations, maintains necessary certifications, and ensures that facilities and equipment are used appropriately. Emergency procedures are understood and practiced so that the team is prepared if an unexpected situation occurs.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the Assistant Coach at Metropolitan S.D. of Washington Township allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.

    <JobTitle>7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach position at Johnathan Dawkins provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Johnathan Dawkins, the 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach at Johnathan Dawkins is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season.

    <JobTitle>Head Coach 7th Grade Softball</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Coach 7th Grade Softball at Ryan Johnson is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the Head Coach 7th Grade Softball is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At Ryan Johnson, the Head Coach 7th Grade Softball helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter. When expectations are not met, the coach responds fairly, explaining consequences and encouraging athletes to learn from mistakes.

The position also requires responsiveness to student needs. Coaches remain aware of the emotional and academic pressures students face and adjust support accordingly. Checking in with athletes, acknowledging their efforts, and partnering with school staff all contribute to a positive experience. The Head Coach 7th Grade Softball may assist in connecting students with resources when additional support is needed.

Outside of direct coaching, the role involves tasks such as coordinating with officials and opponents, assisting with scheduling, and managing team communication channels.

This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Middle School Asst. Track Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Greenwood Community School Corporation with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Middle School Asst. Track Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants.

    <JobDescription>
The NPHS Girls Asst. Golf Coach at New Prairie High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the NPHS Girls Asst. Golf Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at New Prairie High School.

    <JobTitle>Head Coach Wrestling</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Coach Wrestling position at Cambridge Public Schools provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the Head Coach Wrestling prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Cambridge Public Schools, the Head Coach Wrestling works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The Head Coach Wrestling encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the Head Coach Wrestling at Cambridge Public Schools is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobDescription>
The Head Men's Soccer Coach position at Concordia University Chicago is an opportunity to shape a positive, inclusive, and hardworking team environment where students learn to love their sport and take pride in representing their school. This role emphasizes relationship‑building, clear expectations, and steady improvement over the course of a season and across multiple years of participation. The coach serves as a daily presence in the lives of student‑athletes, modeling the type of attitude and work ethic that leads to both athletic and personal growth.

At the core of the job is teaching. The Head Men's Soccer Coach is responsible for breaking down complex skills into manageable steps, offering demonstrations, and creating drills that allow athletes to practice safely and effectively. Practices should be organized around clear objectives, with time built in for warm‑up, instruction, repetition, and review. The coach gives frequent feedback, adjusts activities based on what athletes need, and encourages questions so that students remain engaged in their learning.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At Concordia University Chicago, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected.

The Head Men's Soccer Coach encourages athletes to support one another, communicate openly, and take pride in representing their school with class.

Beyond the field, court, track, or pool, the coach collaborates with school staff to support student‑athletes as whole people. That includes reinforcing academic expectations, respecting school policies, and helping students manage the demands of both athletics and coursework. Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Head Men's Soccer Coach also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning. The coach is expected to stay current with best practices in training, injury prevention, and sport‑specific strategy, and to maintain any certifications required by the district or state association.

    <JobTitle>Girls Soccer Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Girls Soccer Coach at Ryan Plovick is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Girls Soccer Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Ryan Plovick, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Girls Soccer Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Girls Soccer Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Ryan Plovick operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Ryan Plovick with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Girls Soccer Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Girls Soccer Coach role at Ryan Plovick.

    <JobDescription>
The Track &amp; Field Jr. high Coach (B) at South Harrison Community Schools is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Track &amp; Field Jr. high Coach (B) plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at South Harrison Community Schools reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Track &amp; Field Jr. high Coach (B) expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Track &amp; Field Jr. high Coach (B) supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Track &amp; Field Jr. high Coach (B) may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at South Harrison Community Schools.

This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Girls Soccer Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at J. Sterling Morton High School District reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Girls Soccer Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Girls Soccer Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Girls Soccer Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at J. Sterling Morton High School District. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Athletic Trainer 1.0 FTE</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Athletic Trainer 1.0 FTE at DeKalb High School is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the Athletic Trainer 1.0 FTE manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the Athletic Trainer 1.0 FTE at DeKalb High School allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.

The Assistant Football Coach role at New Trier High School emphasizes collaboration, consistency, and long‑term program development. This position is ideal for a coach who enjoys working as part of a broader athletic staff and who values building connections across grade levels and teams. The goal is to help create a smooth pathway for student‑athletes as they progress, while maintaining a recognizable identity and standard of excellence for the program.

In practical terms, the Assistant Football Coach coordinates closely with the athletic director and fellow coaches to align terminology, teaching priorities, and expectations. This might involve participating in coaching meetings, sharing practice plans, and adapting approaches so that athletes experience similar structures and messages at each level. At New Trier High School, the program is strongest when coaches communicate and support one another.

Day‑to‑day responsibilities include designing practices that teach core skills, reinforcing team concepts, and preparing athletes for competition. The coach works to balance repetition with variety, ensuring that key fundamentals are constantly reinforced while athletes also experience new challenges. The Assistant Football Coach reviews performance with the team, helping athletes learn how to analyze both successes and mistakes in a constructive way.

The role extends into community and family engagement. Coaches represent New Trier High School at games, parent meetings, and potential youth outreach events. The Assistant Football Coach may help host clinics or camps, encourage younger students to try the sport, and provide information about expectations to families who are new to the program. A welcoming, organized presence can greatly influence how the program is perceived.

Athlete support is ongoing. The Assistant Football Coach monitors team morale, assists students in managing the demands of school and sport, and reinforces the importance of rest, nutrition, and healthy habits. The coach keeps the focus on sustainable growth rather than shortcuts, emphasizing that consistent effort over time leads to meaningful improvement.

Administrative tasks such as roster management, schedule communication, and equipment oversight are also part of the position. The Assistant Football Coach must handle these responsibilities reliably, as they are essential to maintaining a well‑run program. Coaches who enjoy seeing the big picture, who are willing to share ideas, and who care about the experience of every athlete will thrive in this role at New Trier High School.

    <JobTitle>Asst Coaches-Pooled Position</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The Asst Coaches-Pooled Position role at Illinois Institute of Technology emphasizes collaboration, consistency, and long‑term program development. This position is ideal for a coach who enjoys working as part of a broader athletic staff and who values building connections across grade levels and teams. The goal is to help create a smooth pathway for student‑athletes as they progress, while maintaining a recognizable identity and standard of excellence for the program.

In practical terms, the Asst Coaches-Pooled Position coordinates closely with the athletic director and fellow coaches to align terminology, teaching priorities, and expectations. This might involve participating in coaching meetings, sharing practice plans, and adapting approaches so that athletes experience similar structures and messages at each level. At Illinois Institute of Technology, the program is strongest when coaches communicate and support one another.

Day‑to‑day responsibilities include designing practices that teach core skills, reinforcing team concepts, and preparing athletes for competition.

Administrative tasks such as roster management, schedule communication, and equipment oversight are also part of the position. The Asst Coaches-Pooled Position must handle these responsibilities reliably, as they are essential to maintaining a well‑run program. Coaches who enjoy seeing the big picture, who are willing to share ideas, and who care about the experience of every athlete will thrive in this role at Illinois Institute of Technology.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>Assistant Coach 7th Grade Softball</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach 7th Grade Softball at Ryan Johnson is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Coach 7th Grade Softball plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Ryan Johnson reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Coach 7th Grade Softball expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Coach 7th Grade Softball supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Coach 7th Grade Softball may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Ryan Johnson. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

The Softball Second Assistant Coach position at South Harrison Community Schools provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

    <JobTitle>7th Grade Volleyball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The 7th Grade Volleyball Coach position at Lebanon Community School Corporation provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the 7th Grade Volleyball Coach prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Lebanon Community School Corporation, the 7th Grade Volleyball Coach works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The 7th Grade Volleyball Coach encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the 7th Grade Volleyball Coach at Lebanon Community School Corporation is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Varsity Assistant Baseball Coach at Methuen High School sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Methuen High School, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Varsity Assistant Baseball Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Varsity Assistant Baseball Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Varsity Assistant Baseball Coach position at Methuen High School is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobTitle>ASSISTANT FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The ASSISTANT FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH at Randy Winn is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the ASSISTANT FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The position carries a strong responsibility for modeling behavior. At Randy Winn, coaches are role models whether they are on the sideline, traveling with the team, or speaking with families. The ASSISTANT FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH demonstrates composure, fairness, and respect, even in emotionally charged situations. Athletes observe and imitate these behaviors, so the coach’s example has a direct impact on team culture.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community. The coach collaborates with staff members, responds to communication from parents and guardians, and participates in department or school events as appropriate. Being visible and approachable helps families feel confident that their children are in a safe, supportive program.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation. The ASSISTANT FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH follows all district and league regulations, maintains necessary certifications, and ensures that facilities and equipment are used appropriately. Emergency procedures are understood and practiced so that the team is prepared if an unexpected situation occurs.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the ASSISTANT FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH at Randy Winn allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Volleyball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Volleyball Coach at Crystal Lake CENTRAL High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Volleyball Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Crystal Lake CENTRAL High School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Volleyball Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Volleyball Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Volleyball Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Crystal Lake CENTRAL High School. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Football Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Football Coach at Augie Fontanetta is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Football Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Augie Fontanetta reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Football Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Football Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Football Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Augie Fontanetta. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>HS Assistant Soccer Coach (F)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The HS Assistant Soccer Coach (F) at Carroll High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the HS Assistant Soccer Coach (F) plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Carroll High School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The HS Assistant Soccer Coach (F) expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the HS Assistant Soccer Coach (F) supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the HS Assistant Soccer Coach (F) may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Carroll High School. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobDescription>
The Boys Varsity Soccer Assistant Coach role at Munster High School is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come.

This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment.

After competitions, the Assistant Girls Track Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Boys Soccer</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Boys Soccer position at Central Campus is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Assistant Boys Soccer works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game.

The goal is to build a program where success is measured not just by wins and losses but by the quality of the experience for everyone involved.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school. The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones. Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At West Campus, the Assistant Boys Basketball is viewed as part of the educational team.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork. Safety protocols, including emergency action planning and injury‑reporting procedures, must be consistently followed.

Overall, the Assistant Boys Basketball at West Campus is best suited for a coach who is excited about teaching, willing to collaborate with colleagues, and prepared to invest in the growth of student‑athletes over multiple seasons. It is an opportunity to provide structure, challenge, and support while representing the school with pride in the larger athletic community.

    <JobDescription>
The Track &amp; Field Junior High Assistant Coach (B) at South Harrison Community Schools is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment.

The Track &amp; Field Junior High Assistant Coach (B) works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at South Harrison Community Schools operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent South Harrison Community Schools with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Track &amp; Field Junior High Assistant Coach (B) reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Track &amp; Field Junior High Assistant Coach (B) role at South Harrison Community Schools.

    <JobTitle>7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach at Blake Arnett is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Blake Arnett reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the 7th Grade Girls Assistant Basketball Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Blake Arnett. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Track Coach at Randy Winn is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the Assistant Track Coach manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The position carries a strong responsibility for modeling behavior. At Randy Winn, coaches are role models whether they are on the sideline, traveling with the team, or speaking with families. The Assistant Track Coach demonstrates composure, fairness, and respect, even in emotionally charged situations. Athletes observe and imitate these behaviors, so the coach’s example has a direct impact on team culture.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community. The coach collaborates with staff members, responds to communication from parents and guardians, and participates in department or school events as appropriate. Being visible and approachable helps families feel confident that their children are in a safe, supportive program.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation. The Assistant Track Coach follows all district and league regulations, maintains necessary certifications, and ensures that facilities and equipment are used appropriately. Emergency procedures are understood and practiced so that the team is prepared if an unexpected situation occurs.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the Assistant Track Coach at Randy Winn allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.

    <JobTitle>Tennis Assistant Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Tennis Assistant Coach position at Bonneville High School is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Tennis Assistant Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Tennis Assistant Coach at Bonneville High School sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Bonneville High School, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Tennis Assistant Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Tennis Assistant Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Tennis Assistant Coach position at Bonneville High School is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobTitle>HEAD FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The HEAD FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH position at Burley High School is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the HEAD FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The HEAD FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH at Burley High School sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Burley High School, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The HEAD FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The HEAD FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the HEAD FRESHMAN VOLLEYBALL COACH position at Burley High School is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobTitle>ASSISTANT JUNIOR VARISTY VOLLEYBALL COACH</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The ASSISTANT JUNIOR VARISTY VOLLEYBALL COACH at Randy Winn is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Volleyball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Volleyball Coach role at Ted Juske is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come. The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

From a competitive standpoint, the Assistant Volleyball Coach is responsible for developing seasonal plans that align practice content, conditioning work, and game preparation. This includes designing practice segments that progress from individual fundamentals to full‑team tactical execution. The coach should be comfortable breaking down film, identifying areas for improvement, and communicating game plans in a way that athletes can understand and apply under pressure.

Equally important is the culture created by the coach. At Ted Juske, teams are expected to demonstrate sportsmanship, respect, and unity. The Assistant Volleyball Coach sets standards for effort in practice, behavior in the classroom, and conduct in the community. That might involve establishing team guidelines, leading discussions about values, and recognizing athletes who demonstrate leadership or growth in those areas. The goal is to build a program where success is measured not just by wins and losses but by the quality of the experience for everyone involved.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school. The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones. Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At Ted Juske, the Assistant Volleyball Coach is viewed as part of the educational team.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork. Safety protocols, including emergency action planning and injury‑reporting procedures, must be consistently followed.

Overall, the Assistant Volleyball Coach at Ted Juske is best suited for a coach who is excited about teaching, willing to collaborate with colleagues, and prepared to invest in the growth of student‑athletes over multiple seasons. It is an opportunity to provide structure, challenge, and support while representing the school with pride in the larger athletic community.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Girls Soccer Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Girls Soccer Coach position at Augie Fontanetta is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Assistant Girls Soccer Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program.

Another important part of the job is collaboration.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Assistant Girls Soccer Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Assistant Girls Soccer Coach position at Augie Fontanetta is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Middle School Tennis Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Middle School Tennis Coach at Michigan City Area Schools is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Middle School Tennis Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Michigan City Area Schools reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Middle School Tennis Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Middle School Tennis Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Middle School Tennis Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Michigan City Area Schools. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Head Middle School Tennis Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Middle School Tennis Coach at Michigan City Area Schools is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Head Middle School Tennis Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Michigan City Area Schools, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Head Middle School Tennis Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Head Middle School Tennis Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Michigan City Area Schools operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Michigan City Area Schools with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Head Middle School Tennis Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Head Middle School Tennis Coach role at Michigan City Area Schools.

    <JobTitle>Boys and Girls Cross Country Assistant Coach (Co-Ed)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Boys and Girls Cross Country Assistant Coach (Co-Ed) at Munster High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Boys and Girls Cross Country Assistant Coach (Co-Ed) is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Munster High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Boys and Girls Cross Country Assistant Coach (Co-Ed) helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Boys and Girls Cross Country Assistant Coach (Co-Ed) works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Munster High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Munster High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Boys and Girls Cross Country Assistant Coach (Co-Ed) reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Boys and Girls Cross Country Assistant Coach (Co-Ed) role at Munster High School.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Track and Field Coach ( Jumps)-BVH</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Track and Field Coach ( Jumps) at BLUE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Assistant Track and Field Coach ( Jumps) is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At BLUE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Assistant Track and Field Coach ( Jumps) helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Assistant Track and Field Coach ( Jumps) works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at BLUE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent BLUE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Assistant Track and Field Coach ( Jumps) reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Assistant Track and Field Coach ( Jumps) role at BLUE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Track Coach at Boise School District is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the Assistant Track Coach is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At Boise School District, the Assistant Track Coach helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter. When expectations are not met, the coach responds fairly, explaining consequences and encouraging athletes to learn from mistakes.

The position also requires responsiveness to student needs. Coaches remain aware of the emotional and academic pressures students face and adjust support accordingly. Checking in with athletes, acknowledging their efforts, and partnering with school staff all contribute to a positive experience. The Assistant Track Coach may assist in connecting students with resources when additional support is needed.

Outside of direct coaching, the role involves tasks such as coordinating with officials and opponents, assisting with scheduling, and managing team communication channels. The coach must be punctual, prepared, and detail‑oriented, ensuring that events run smoothly and that the team represents Boise School District well at home and away.

Safety remains an ongoing responsibility. The Assistant Track Coach follows district guidelines, maintains necessary certifications, and emphasizes proper warm‑up routines and technique to minimize risk of injury. This comprehensive approach to coaching allows student‑athletes to pursue their goals in a structured environment that prioritizes learning, well‑being, and long‑term success.

    <JobDescription>
The Head Boys Track at West Campus is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes.

    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach (Men's Wrestling) at Harper College is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Harper College, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Assistant Coach (Men's Wrestling) helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Assistant Coach (Men's Wrestling) works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Harper College operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Harper College with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Assistant Coach (Men's Wrestling) reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Assistant Coach (Men's Wrestling) role at Harper College.
