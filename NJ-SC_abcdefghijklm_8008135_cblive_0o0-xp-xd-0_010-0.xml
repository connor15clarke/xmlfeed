The Head Football Coach at Scranton High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Head Football Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Scranton High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Head Football Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Head Football Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Scranton High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Scranton High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Head Football Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Head Football Coach role at Scranton High School.

The Football Head Coach at Cedar Cliff High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

    <JobDescription>
The Supplemental Coach position at W A PERRY MIDDLE SCHOOL is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

The Supplemental Coach at DREHER HIGH SCHOOL is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

The Supplemental Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department.

Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at DREHER HIGH SCHOOL operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent DREHER HIGH SCHOOL with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Supplemental Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Supplemental Coach role at DREHER HIGH SCHOOL.

The Physical Education Teacher/Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach sets standards for effort in practice, behavior in the classroom, and conduct in the community. That might involve establishing team guidelines, leading discussions about values, and recognizing athletes who demonstrate leadership or growth in those areas. The goal is to build a program where success is measured not just by wins and losses but by the quality of the experience for everyone involved.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school. The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones. Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At Northwestern High School, the Physical Education Teacher/Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach is viewed as part of the educational team.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork. Safety protocols, including emergency action planning and injury‑reporting procedures, must be consistently followed.

Overall, the Physical Education Teacher/Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach at Northwestern High School is best suited for a coach who is excited about teaching, willing to collaborate with colleagues, and prepared to invest in the growth of student‑athletes over multiple seasons. It is an opportunity to provide structure, challenge, and support while representing the school with pride in the larger athletic community.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Girls Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Girls Track Coach position at Middle School West is an opportunity to shape a positive, inclusive, and hardworking team environment where students learn to love their sport and take pride in representing their school. This role emphasizes relationship‑building, clear expectations, and steady improvement over the course of a season and across multiple years of participation. The coach serves as a daily presence in the lives of student‑athletes, modeling the type of attitude and work ethic that leads to both athletic and personal growth.

At the core of the job is teaching. The Assistant Girls Track Coach is responsible for breaking down complex skills into manageable steps, offering demonstrations, and creating drills that allow athletes to practice safely and effectively. Practices should be organized around clear objectives, with time built in for warm‑up, instruction, repetition, and review. The coach gives frequent feedback, adjusts activities based on what athletes need, and encourages questions so that students remain engaged in their learning.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At Middle School West, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected. That means setting guidelines that prevent negative behavior, addressing conflicts quickly and fairly, and celebrating contributions from both starters and role players. The Assistant Girls Track Coach encourages athletes to support one another, communicate openly, and take pride in representing their school with class.

Beyond the field, court, track, or pool, the coach collaborates with school staff to support student‑athletes as whole people. That includes reinforcing academic expectations, respecting school policies, and helping students manage the demands of both athletics and coursework. Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Assistant Girls Track Coach also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning. The coach is expected to stay current with best practices in training, injury prevention, and sport‑specific strategy, and to maintain any certifications required by the district or state association.

For individuals who enjoy working with young people, who believe in the value of school‑based athletics, and who are prepared to invest time in building a healthy team culture, the Assistant Girls Track Coach role at Middle School West is a meaningful and impactful opportunity.

    <JobTitle>JH Girls Lacrosse Assistant Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The JH Girls Lacrosse Assistant Coach at Sycamore Junior High School is a high‑engagement coaching role that calls for energy, clear communication, and a steady presence for student‑athletes. This position is built for a coach who enjoys being actively involved in every aspect of the program, from leading warm‑ups and teaching tactics to meeting with families and coordinating logistics. The coach is expected to bring consistency and enthusiasm to each interaction with the team.

Practices led by the JH Girls Lacrosse Assistant Coach are structured and purposeful. They begin with appropriate warm‑ups, transition into focused skill work, and conclude with competitive or situational activities that resemble live play. The coach introduces concepts in manageable steps and checks for understanding, encouraging athletes to ask questions and learn the reasoning behind drills and strategies. This approach helps athletes become smarter, more confident players.

Motivation is another key component of the job. Coaches at Sycamore Junior High School use positive reinforcement, high yet realistic expectations, and clear feedback to help athletes push themselves.

    <JobTitle>Middle School - Spring Sports</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Middle School - Spring Sports at Watkins Middle School is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the Middle School - Spring Sports is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At Watkins Middle School, the Middle School - Spring Sports helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter. When expectations are not met, the coach responds fairly, explaining consequences and encouraging athletes to learn from mistakes.

    <JobTitle>Volunteer Athletic Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Volunteer Athletic Coach position at East High School provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the Volunteer Athletic Coach prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At East High School, the Volunteer Athletic Coach works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The Volunteer Athletic Coach encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the Volunteer Athletic Coach at East High School is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobTitle>Volunteer Athletic Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Volunteer Athletic Coach position at East Middle School @ P Ross Berry Campus is an opportunity to shape a positive, inclusive, and hardworking team environment where students learn to love their sport and take pride in representing their school. This role emphasizes relationship‑building, clear expectations, and steady improvement over the course of a season and across multiple years of participation. The coach serves as a daily presence in the lives of student‑athletes, modeling the type of attitude and work ethic that leads to both athletic and personal growth.

At the core of the job is teaching. The Volunteer Athletic Coach is responsible for breaking down complex skills into manageable steps, offering demonstrations, and creating drills that allow athletes to practice safely and effectively. Practices should be organized around clear objectives, with time built in for warm‑up, instruction, repetition, and review. The coach gives frequent feedback, adjusts activities based on what athletes need, and encourages questions so that students remain engaged in their learning.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At East Middle School @ P Ross Berry Campus, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected. That means setting guidelines that prevent negative behavior, addressing conflicts quickly and fairly, and celebrating contributions from both starters and role players. The Volunteer Athletic Coach encourages athletes to support one another, communicate openly, and take pride in representing their school with class.

Beyond the field, court, track, or pool, the coach collaborates with school staff to support student‑athletes as whole people. That includes reinforcing academic expectations, respecting school policies, and helping students manage the demands of both athletics and coursework. Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Volunteer Athletic Coach also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning. The coach is expected to stay current with best practices in training, injury prevention, and sport‑specific strategy, and to maintain any certifications required by the district or state association.

For individuals who enjoy working with young people, who believe in the value of school‑based athletics, and who are prepared to invest time in building a healthy team culture, the Volunteer Athletic Coach role at East Middle School @ P Ross Berry Campus is a meaningful and impactful opportunity.

    <JobTitle>Volleyball Head Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Volleyball Head Coach at Anthony Wayne High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Volleyball Head Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Anthony Wayne High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Volleyball Head Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Volleyball Head Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Anthony Wayne High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Anthony Wayne High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Volleyball Head Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Volleyball Head Coach role at Anthony Wayne High School.

    <JobTitle>JV Girls Soccer Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The JV Girls Soccer Coach role at HIGH SCHOOL is focused on helping student‑athletes unlock their potential through intentional coaching, structured practice environments, and a strong emphasis on character. This description outlines a position in which the coach is expected to be a planner, a teacher, a mentor, and a positive representative of the school community. Successful candidates bring energy to practices, patience to instruction, and clarity to expectations.

Practices form the backbone of the program, and the JV Girls Soccer Coach is responsible for designing sessions that are purposeful and efficient. Each practice should have defined goals, from teaching new concepts to reinforcing previously learned skills or preparing for upcoming competition. The coach uses a variety of drills and teaching methods to keep athletes engaged, and regularly evaluates whether the team is progressing in the desired areas.

Coaches at HIGH SCHOOL are also trusted to guide student‑athletes through challenges. That can include addressing frustrations after a tough loss, helping a student handle the pressure of increased responsibility, or supporting someone who is balancing school, family, and activities. The JV Girls Soccer Coach listens, provides perspective, and reinforces the idea that effort, attitude, and resilience are as important as any statistical outcome.

Communication is a key strength of this position. The coach shares information about schedules, team policies, and expectations with families and staff in a timely and professional way. Within the team, the JV Girls Soccer Coach encourages athletes to ask questions, give feedback, and support one another. This open communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds trust.

Safety and compliance cannot be overlooked. The JV Girls Soccer Coach follows all relevant policies regarding equipment, supervision, travel, and emergency procedures. The coach maintains current certifications as required and keeps up with best practices around conditioning, concussion awareness, and hydration. At HIGH SCHOOL, the well‑being of student‑athletes is non‑negotiable.

This role is a good match for coaches who appreciate structure, care deeply about students, and are committed to building a consistent, values‑driven program. By serving as the JV Girls Soccer Coach at HIGH SCHOOL, a coach has the opportunity to make a lasting impact on young people while contributing to a respected and sustainable athletic tradition.

    <JobTitle>Head Boys Soccer Coach (2026-2027)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Boys Soccer Coach position at GRANVILLE HIGH SCHOOL is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Head Boys Soccer Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Head Boys Soccer Coach at GRANVILLE HIGH SCHOOL sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At GRANVILLE HIGH SCHOOL, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Head Boys Soccer Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Head Boys Soccer Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Head Boys Soccer Coach position at GRANVILLE HIGH SCHOOL is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobTitle>Girls Golf - Head Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Girls Golf - Head Coach at Bay High School is a high‑engagement coaching role that calls for energy, clear communication, and a steady presence for student‑athletes. This position is built for a coach who enjoys being actively involved in every aspect of the program, from leading warm‑ups and teaching tactics to meeting with families and coordinating logistics. The coach is expected to bring consistency and enthusiasm to each interaction with the team.

They begin with appropriate warm‑ups, transition into focused skill work, and conclude with competitive or situational activities that resemble live play. The coach introduces concepts in manageable steps and checks for understanding, encouraging athletes to ask questions and learn the reasoning behind drills and strategies. This approach helps athletes become smarter, more confident players.

Motivation is another key component of the job. Coaches at Bay High School use positive reinforcement, high yet realistic expectations, and clear feedback to help athletes push themselves.

Within the school, the Girls Golf - Head Coach collaborates with administrators and teachers to support students’ academic responsibilities, reinforcing that success in the classroom is essential.

Finally, the position requires adherence to safety and policy standards.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Boys Lacrosse Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Boys Lacrosse Coach at Hempfield High School is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the Assistant Boys Lacrosse Coach is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At Hempfield High School, the Assistant Boys Lacrosse Coach helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter.

The position also requires responsiveness to student needs. Coaches remain aware of the emotional and academic pressures students face and adjust support accordingly. Checking in with athletes, acknowledging their efforts, and partnering with school staff all contribute to a positive experience. The Assistant Boys Lacrosse Coach may assist in connecting students with resources when additional support is needed.

Outside of direct coaching, the role involves tasks such as coordinating with officials and opponents, assisting with scheduling, and managing team communication channels. The coach must be punctual, prepared, and detail‑oriented, ensuring that events run smoothly and that the team represents Hempfield High School well at home and away.

    <JobTitle>Boys 8th Grade Tennis - Head Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Boys 8th Grade Tennis - Head Coach position at Black Rock Middle School is an opportunity to shape a positive, inclusive, and hardworking team environment where students learn to love their sport and take pride in representing their school. This role emphasizes relationship‑building, clear expectations, and steady improvement over the course of a season and across multiple years of participation. The coach serves as a daily presence in the lives of student‑athletes, modeling the type of attitude and work ethic that leads to both athletic and personal growth.

At the core of the job is teaching. The Boys 8th Grade Tennis - Head Coach is responsible for breaking down complex skills into manageable steps, offering demonstrations, and creating drills that allow athletes to practice safely and effectively. Practices should be organized around clear objectives, with time built in for warm‑up, instruction, repetition, and review. The coach gives frequent feedback, adjusts activities based on what athletes need, and encourages questions so that students remain engaged in their learning.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At Black Rock Middle School, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected.

The Boys 8th Grade Tennis - Head Coach encourages athletes to support one another, communicate openly, and take pride in representing their school with class.

Beyond the field, court, track, or pool, the coach collaborates with school staff to support student‑athletes as whole people. That includes reinforcing academic expectations, respecting school policies, and helping students manage the demands of both athletics and coursework. Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Boys 8th Grade Tennis - Head Coach also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning. The coach is expected to stay current with best practices in training, injury prevention, and sport‑specific strategy, and to maintain any certifications required by the district or state association.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At Avon Grove High School, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected. That means setting guidelines that prevent negative behavior, addressing conflicts quickly and fairly, and celebrating contributions from both starters and role players. The Head Varsity Girls Lacrosse Coach encourages athletes to support one another, communicate openly, and take pride in representing their school with class.

Beyond the field, court, track, or pool, the coach collaborates with school staff to support student‑athletes as whole people. That includes reinforcing academic expectations, respecting school policies, and helping students manage the demands of both athletics and coursework. Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Head Varsity Girls Lacrosse Coach also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning. The coach is expected to stay current with best practices in training, injury prevention, and sport‑specific strategy, and to maintain any certifications required by the district or state association.

For individuals who enjoy working with young people, who believe in the value of school‑based athletics, and who are prepared to invest time in building a healthy team culture, the Head Varsity Girls Lacrosse Coach role at Avon Grove High School is a meaningful and impactful opportunity.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Track Coach - WAMS (2 positions)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Track Coach - WAMS (2 positions) at Waynesboro Area Middle School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Track Coach - WAMS (2 positions) plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Waynesboro Area Middle School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Track Coach - WAMS (2 positions) expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Track Coach - WAMS (2 positions) supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Track Coach - WAMS (2 positions) may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Waynesboro Area Middle School. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Assistant and Volunteer Coach (by appointment only)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant and Volunteer Coach (by appointment only) at Moon Area High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant and Volunteer Coach (by appointment only) plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Moon Area High School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant and Volunteer Coach (by appointment only) expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant and Volunteer Coach (by appointment only) supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant and Volunteer Coach (by appointment only) may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Moon Area High School. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Head Coach - Girls Soccer (2026-27 SY)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Coach - Girls Soccer role at Woodbridge High School is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come. The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

From a competitive standpoint, the Head Coach - Girls Soccer is responsible for developing seasonal plans that align practice content, conditioning work, and game preparation. This includes designing practice segments that progress from individual fundamentals to full‑team tactical execution. The coach should be comfortable breaking down film, identifying areas for improvement, and communicating game plans in a way that athletes can understand and apply under pressure.

Equally important is the culture created by the coach. At Woodbridge High School, teams are expected to demonstrate sportsmanship, respect, and unity. The Head Coach - Girls Soccer sets standards for effort in practice, behavior in the classroom, and conduct in the community. That might involve establishing team guidelines, leading discussions about values, and recognizing athletes who demonstrate leadership or growth in those areas. The goal is to build a program where success is measured not just by wins and losses but by the quality of the experience for everyone involved.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school. The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones. Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At Woodbridge High School, the Head Coach - Girls Soccer is viewed as part of the educational team.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork. Safety protocols, including emergency action planning and injury‑reporting procedures, must be consistently followed.

Overall, the Head Coach - Girls Soccer at Woodbridge High School is best suited for a coach who is excited about teaching, willing to collaborate with colleagues, and prepared to invest in the growth of student‑athletes over multiple seasons.

    <JobDescription>
The LLHS-Assistant Tennis Coach 25-26 position at LLHS Athletics provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the LLHS-Assistant Tennis Coach 25-26 prepares practices that sequence learning effectively.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At LLHS Athletics, the LLHS-Assistant Tennis Coach 25-26 works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility.

    <JobTitle>District Pole Vault Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The District Pole Vault Coach at Arlington Central Office is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the District Pole Vault Coach is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At Arlington Central Office, the District Pole Vault Coach helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter. When expectations are not met, the coach responds fairly, explaining consequences and encouraging athletes to learn from mistakes.

The position also requires responsiveness to student needs. Coaches remain aware of the emotional and academic pressures students face and adjust support accordingly. Checking in with athletes, acknowledging their efforts, and partnering with school staff all contribute to a positive experience. The District Pole Vault Coach may assist in connecting students with resources when additional support is needed.

Outside of direct coaching, the role involves tasks such as coordinating with officials and opponents, assisting with scheduling, and managing team communication channels. The coach must be punctual, prepared, and detail‑oriented, ensuring that events run smoothly and that the team represents Arlington Central Office well at home and away.

Safety remains an ongoing responsibility. The District Pole Vault Coach follows district guidelines, maintains necessary certifications, and emphasizes proper warm‑up routines and technique to minimize risk of injury. This comprehensive approach to coaching allows student‑athletes to pursue their goals in a structured environment that prioritizes learning, well‑being, and long‑term success.
