    <JobDescription>The Athletic Trainer at Dearborn City School District is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role.

    <JobTitle>7th Grade Boys Baseball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The 7th Grade Boys Baseball Coach at Deputy Superintendent or Director of Personnel is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the 7th Grade Boys Baseball Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Deputy Superintendent or Director of Personnel reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The 7th Grade Boys Baseball Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the 7th Grade Boys Baseball Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the 7th Grade Boys Baseball Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Deputy Superintendent or Director of Personnel. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>Assistant Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The Assistant Track Coach at 150-Truman High School is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the Assistant Track Coach manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The position carries a strong responsibility for modeling behavior. At 150-Truman High School, coaches are role models whether they are on the sideline, traveling with the team, or speaking with families. The Assistant Track Coach demonstrates composure, fairness, and respect, even in emotionally charged situations. Athletes observe and imitate these behaviors, so the coach’s example has a direct impact on team culture.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community. The coach collaborates with staff members, responds to communication from parents and guardians, and participates in department or school events as appropriate. Being visible and approachable helps families feel confident that their children are in a safe, supportive program.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation. The Assistant Track Coach follows all district and league regulations, maintains necessary certifications, and ensures that facilities and equipment are used appropriately. Emergency procedures are understood and practiced so that the team is prepared if an unexpected situation occurs.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the Assistant Track Coach at 150-Truman High School allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>Head Cross Country Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The Head Cross Country Coach at 210-Bridger Middle School is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the Head Cross Country Coach is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At 210-Bridger Middle School, the Head Cross Country Coach helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter. When expectations are not met, the coach responds fairly, explaining consequences and encouraging athletes to learn from mistakes.

The position also requires responsiveness to student needs. Coaches remain aware of the emotional and academic pressures students face and adjust support accordingly. Checking in with athletes, acknowledging their efforts, and partnering with school staff all contribute to a positive experience. The Head Cross Country Coach may assist in connecting students with resources when additional support is needed.

Outside of direct coaching, the role involves tasks such as coordinating with officials and opponents, assisting with scheduling, and managing team communication channels. The coach must be punctual, prepared, and detail‑oriented, ensuring that events run smoothly and that the team represents 210-Bridger Middle School well at home and away.

Safety remains an ongoing responsibility. The Head Cross Country Coach follows district guidelines, maintains necessary certifications, and emphasizes proper warm‑up routines and technique to minimize risk of injury.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Gymnastics Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The Assistant Gymnastics Coach at High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Gymnastics Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at High School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Gymnastics Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Gymnastics Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Gymnastics Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at High School. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>Assistant Basketball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Basketball Coach at Mount Olive Middle is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Basketball Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Mount Olive Middle reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Basketball Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Basketball Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Basketball Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Mount Olive Middle. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Head Womens Soccer Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Womens Soccer Coach at Hillside High School is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the Head Womens Soccer Coach manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The position carries a strong responsibility for modeling behavior. At Hillside High School, coaches are role models whether they are on the sideline, traveling with the team, or speaking with families. The Head Womens Soccer Coach demonstrates composure, fairness, and respect, even in emotionally charged situations. Athletes observe and imitate these behaviors, so the coach’s example has a direct impact on team culture.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community. The coach collaborates with staff members, responds to communication from parents and guardians, and participates in department or school events as appropriate. Being visible and approachable helps families feel confident that their children are in a safe, supportive program.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation. The Head Womens Soccer Coach follows all district and league regulations, maintains necessary certifications, and ensures that facilities and equipment are used appropriately. Emergency procedures are understood and practiced so that the team is prepared if an unexpected situation occurs.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the Head Womens Soccer Coach at Hillside High School allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.

    <JobTitle>High School Athletic Director</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The High School Athletic Director role at Lake Norman High School is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come. The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

From a competitive standpoint, the High School Athletic Director is responsible for developing seasonal plans that align practice content, conditioning work, and game preparation. This includes designing practice segments that progress from individual fundamentals to full‑team tactical execution. The coach should be comfortable breaking down film, identifying areas for improvement, and communicating game plans in a way that athletes can understand and apply under pressure.

Equally important is the culture created by the coach. At Lake Norman High School, teams are expected to demonstrate sportsmanship, respect, and unity. The High School Athletic Director sets standards for effort in practice, behavior in the classroom, and conduct in the community. That might involve establishing team guidelines, leading discussions about values, and recognizing athletes who demonstrate leadership or growth in those areas. The goal is to build a program where success is measured not just by wins and losses but by the quality of the experience for everyone involved.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school. The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones. Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At Lake Norman High School, the High School Athletic Director is viewed as part of the educational team.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork. Safety protocols, including emergency action planning and injury‑reporting procedures, must be consistently followed.

Overall, the High School Athletic Director at Lake Norman High School is best suited for a coach who is excited about teaching, willing to collaborate with colleagues, and prepared to invest in the growth of student‑athletes over multiple seasons. It is an opportunity to provide structure, challenge, and support while representing the school with pride in the larger athletic community.

    <JobTitle>Head Coach - Girl's Soccer</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Coach - Girl's Soccer at Riverwood Middle is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Head Coach - Girl's Soccer is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Riverwood Middle, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Head Coach - Girl's Soccer helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Head Coach - Girl's Soccer works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Riverwood Middle operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Riverwood Middle with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Head Coach - Girl's Soccer reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Head Coach - Girl's Soccer role at Riverwood Middle.

The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Head Men's &amp; Women's Track Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Maiden High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Head Men's &amp; Women's Track Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Head Men's &amp; Women's Track Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Maiden High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Maiden High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Head Men's &amp; Women's Track Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Head Men's &amp; Women's Track Coach role at Maiden High School.

    <JobTitle>VCHS Golf Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The VCHS Golf Coach at Vance County High School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the VCHS Golf Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Vance County High School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The VCHS Golf Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

    <JobTitle>MS Girls Track Head Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The MS Girls Track Head Coach position at Swain Middle School provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the MS Girls Track Head Coach prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Swain Middle School, the MS Girls Track Head Coach works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The MS Girls Track Head Coach encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the MS Girls Track Head Coach at Swain Middle School is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobDescription>
The Head Athletic Coach (Continuous Posting) position at Mattamuskeet School is an opportunity to shape a positive, inclusive, and hardworking team environment where students learn to love their sport and take pride in representing their school. This role emphasizes relationship‑building, clear expectations, and steady improvement over the course of a season and across multiple years of participation. The coach serves as a daily presence in the lives of student‑athletes, modeling the type of attitude and work ethic that leads to both athletic and personal growth.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At Mattamuskeet School, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected.

Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Head Athletic Coach (Continuous Posting) also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning.

    <JobDescription>
The Middle School Assistant Girls Track Coach at Jamestown Middle School is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Middle School Assistant Girls Track Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Jamestown Middle School reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Middle School Assistant Girls Track Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Middle School Assistant Girls Track Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Middle School Assistant Girls Track Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Jamestown Middle School. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.
