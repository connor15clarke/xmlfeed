    <JobTitle>TENNIS BOYS ASSISTANT COACH</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The TENNIS BOYS ASSISTANT COACH at Vintage High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the TENNIS BOYS ASSISTANT COACH is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Vintage High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The TENNIS BOYS ASSISTANT COACH helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The TENNIS BOYS ASSISTANT COACH works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Vintage High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Vintage High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the TENNIS BOYS ASSISTANT COACH reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the TENNIS BOYS ASSISTANT COACH role at Vintage High School.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Wrestling Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The Assistant Wrestling Coach role at California Baptist University emphasizes collaboration, consistency, and long‑term program development. This position is ideal for a coach who enjoys working as part of a broader athletic staff and who values building connections across grade levels and teams. The goal is to help create a smooth pathway for student‑athletes as they progress, while maintaining a recognizable identity and standard of excellence for the program.

In practical terms, the Assistant Wrestling Coach coordinates closely with the athletic director and fellow coaches to align terminology, teaching priorities, and expectations. This might involve participating in coaching meetings, sharing practice plans, and adapting approaches so that athletes experience similar structures and messages at each level. At California Baptist University, the program is strongest when coaches communicate and support one another.

Day‑to‑day responsibilities include designing practices that teach core skills, reinforcing team concepts, and preparing athletes for competition. The coach works to balance repetition with variety, ensuring that key fundamentals are constantly reinforced while athletes also experience new challenges. The Assistant Wrestling Coach reviews performance with the team, helping athletes learn how to analyze both successes and mistakes in a constructive way.

The role extends into community and family engagement. Coaches represent California Baptist University at games, parent meetings, and potential youth outreach events. The Assistant Wrestling Coach may help host clinics or camps, encourage younger students to try the sport, and provide information about expectations to families who are new to the program. A welcoming, organized presence can greatly influence how the program is perceived.

Athlete support is ongoing. The Assistant Wrestling Coach monitors team morale, assists students in managing the demands of school and sport, and reinforces the importance of rest, nutrition, and healthy habits. The coach keeps the focus on sustainable growth rather than shortcuts, emphasizing that consistent effort over time leads to meaningful improvement.

Administrative tasks such as roster management, schedule communication, and equipment oversight are also part of the position. The Assistant Wrestling Coach must handle these responsibilities reliably, as they are essential to maintaining a well‑run program. Coaches who enjoy seeing the big picture, who are willing to share ideas, and who care about the experience of every athlete will thrive in this role at California Baptist University.</JobDescription>

The Assistant Athletic Director of Development position at University of San Diego is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Assistant Athletic Director of Development works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program.

    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach at Clarksville-Mongomery County is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Clarksville-Mongomery County reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program.

    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach - Girls' Basketball at Glinda Medina is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Glinda Medina, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Assistant Coach - Girls' Basketball works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Glinda Medina operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Glinda Medina with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Assistant Coach - Girls' Basketball reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Assistant Coach - Girls' Basketball role at Glinda Medina.

    <JobTitle>Track and Field Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>The Track and Field Coach role at Graham Middle School is focused on helping student‑athletes unlock their potential through intentional coaching, structured practice environments, and a strong emphasis on character. This description outlines a position in which the coach is expected to be a planner, a teacher, a mentor, and a positive representative of the school community. Successful candidates bring energy to practices, patience to instruction, and clarity to expectations.

Practices form the backbone of the program, and the Track and Field Coach is responsible for designing sessions that are purposeful and efficient. Each practice should have defined goals, from teaching new concepts to reinforcing previously learned skills or preparing for upcoming competition. The coach uses a variety of drills and teaching methods to keep athletes engaged, and regularly evaluates whether the team is progressing in the desired areas.

Coaches at Graham Middle School are also trusted to guide student‑athletes through challenges. That can include addressing frustrations after a tough loss, helping a student handle the pressure of increased responsibility, or supporting someone who is balancing school, family, and activities. The Track and Field Coach listens, provides perspective, and reinforces the idea that effort, attitude, and resilience are as important as any statistical outcome.

Communication is a key strength of this position. The coach shares information about schedules, team policies, and expectations with families and staff in a timely and professional way. Within the team, the Track and Field Coach encourages athletes to ask questions, give feedback, and support one another. This open communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds trust.

Safety and compliance cannot be overlooked. The Track and Field Coach follows all relevant policies regarding equipment, supervision, travel, and emergency procedures. The coach maintains current certifications as required and keeps up with best practices around conditioning, concussion awareness, and hydration. At Graham Middle School, the well‑being of student‑athletes is non‑negotiable.

This role is a good match for coaches who appreciate structure, care deeply about students, and are committed to building a consistent, values‑driven program. By serving as the Track and Field Coach at Graham Middle School, a coach has the opportunity to make a lasting impact on young people while contributing to a respected and sustainable athletic tradition.</JobDescription>

    <JobTitle>ATHLETIC TRAINER</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The ATHLETIC TRAINER at Bassett Unified is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the ATHLETIC TRAINER plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Bassett Unified reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The ATHLETIC TRAINER expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the ATHLETIC TRAINER supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the ATHLETIC TRAINER may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Bassett Unified. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobDescription>
The Varsity Co-Ed Golf Coach at Adam Cano is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Adam Cano, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Varsity Co-Ed Golf Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Varsity Co-Ed Golf Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Adam Cano operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Adam Cano with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Varsity Co-Ed Golf Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Varsity Co-Ed Golf Coach role at Adam Cano.

In practical terms, the Varsity Track Head Coach coordinates closely with the athletic director and fellow coaches to align terminology, teaching priorities, and expectations. This might involve participating in coaching meetings, sharing practice plans, and adapting approaches so that athletes experience similar structures and messages at each level. At Calipatria Unified, the program is strongest when coaches communicate and support one another.

Day‑to‑day responsibilities include designing practices that teach core skills, reinforcing team concepts, and preparing athletes for competition. The coach works to balance repetition with variety, ensuring that key fundamentals are constantly reinforced while athletes also experience new challenges. The Varsity Track Head Coach reviews performance with the team, helping athletes learn how to analyze both successes and mistakes in a constructive way.

The role extends into community and family engagement. Coaches represent Calipatria Unified at games, parent meetings, and potential youth outreach events. The Varsity Track Head Coach may help host clinics or camps, encourage younger students to try the sport, and provide information about expectations to families who are new to the program. A welcoming, organized presence can greatly influence how the program is perceived.

Athlete support is ongoing. The Varsity Track Head Coach monitors team morale, assists students in managing the demands of school and sport, and reinforces the importance of rest, nutrition, and healthy habits. The coach keeps the focus on sustainable growth rather than shortcuts, emphasizing that consistent effort over time leads to meaningful improvement.

Administrative tasks such as roster management, schedule communication, and equipment oversight are also part of the position. The Varsity Track Head Coach must handle these responsibilities reliably, as they are essential to maintaining a well‑run program. Coaches who enjoy seeing the big picture, who are willing to share ideas, and who care about the experience of every athlete will thrive in this role at Calipatria Unified.

This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

After competitions, the 9-12th Grade COACH/Classroom Teacher reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

    <JobTitle>Baseball, JV Assistant Coach at LAHS</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Baseball, JV Assistant Coach at LAHS position at Los Altos High School is an opportunity to shape a positive, inclusive, and hardworking team environment where students learn to love their sport and take pride in representing their school. This role emphasizes relationship‑building, clear expectations, and steady improvement over the course of a season and across multiple years of participation. The coach serves as a daily presence in the lives of student‑athletes, modeling the type of attitude and work ethic that leads to both athletic and personal growth.

At the core of the job is teaching. The Baseball, JV Assistant Coach at LAHS is responsible for breaking down complex skills into manageable steps, offering demonstrations, and creating drills that allow athletes to practice safely and effectively. Practices should be organized around clear objectives, with time built in for warm‑up, instruction, repetition, and review. The coach gives frequent feedback, adjusts activities based on what athletes need, and encourages questions so that students remain engaged in their learning.

The role also involves nurturing team chemistry and a sense of belonging. At Los Altos High School, coaches work to make sure every athlete feels included and respected. That means setting guidelines that prevent negative behavior, addressing conflicts quickly and fairly, and celebrating contributions from both starters and role players. The Baseball, JV Assistant Coach at LAHS encourages athletes to support one another, communicate openly, and take pride in representing their school with class.

Beyond the field, court, track, or pool, the coach collaborates with school staff to support student‑athletes as whole people. That includes reinforcing academic expectations, respecting school policies, and helping students manage the demands of both athletics and coursework. Regular contact with families keeps everyone informed about schedules, expectations, and program goals, and offers a consistent channel for questions or concerns.

The Baseball, JV Assistant Coach at LAHS also participates in broader program responsibilities such as attending department meetings, assisting with youth outreach or clinics, and contributing to long‑term planning. The coach is expected to stay current with best practices in training, injury prevention, and sport‑specific strategy, and to maintain any certifications required by the district or state association.

For individuals who enjoy working with young people, who believe in the value of school‑based athletics, and who are prepared to invest time in building a healthy team culture, the Baseball, JV Assistant Coach at LAHS role at Los Altos High School is a meaningful and impactful opportunity.

    <JobTitle>JV Softball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The JV Softball Coach role at Aaron Brooks is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes. This position blends strategy, culture‑building, and teaching, providing the coach with an opportunity to influence the direction of the program for years to come. The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

From a competitive standpoint, the JV Softball Coach is responsible for developing seasonal plans that align practice content, conditioning work, and game preparation. This includes designing practice segments that progress from individual fundamentals to full‑team tactical execution. The coach should be comfortable breaking down film, identifying areas for improvement, and communicating game plans in a way that athletes can understand and apply under pressure.

Equally important is the culture created by the coach. At Aaron Brooks, teams are expected to demonstrate sportsmanship, respect, and unity. The JV Softball Coach sets standards for effort in practice, behavior in the classroom, and conduct in the community. That might involve establishing team guidelines, leading discussions about values, and recognizing athletes who demonstrate leadership or growth in those areas. The goal is to build a program where success is measured not just by wins and losses but by the quality of the experience for everyone involved.

This position also involves close coordination with the academic side of the school. The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones. Communicating with teachers and counselors when necessary helps support student‑athletes as whole people, not just as performers in one activity. At Aaron Brooks, the JV Softball Coach is viewed as part of the educational team.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork. Safety protocols, including emergency action planning and injury‑reporting procedures, must be consistently followed.

Overall, the JV Softball Coach at Aaron Brooks is best suited for a coach who is excited about teaching, willing to collaborate with colleagues, and prepared to invest in the growth of student‑athletes over multiple seasons. It is an opportunity to provide structure, challenge, and support while representing the school with pride in the larger athletic community.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Track Coach at Kristie Pearson is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the Assistant Track Coach manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The position carries a strong responsibility for modeling behavior. At Kristie Pearson, coaches are role models whether they are on the sideline, traveling with the team, or speaking with families. The Assistant Track Coach demonstrates composure, fairness, and respect, even in emotionally charged situations. Athletes observe and imitate these behaviors, so the coach’s example has a direct impact on team culture.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community. The coach collaborates with staff members, responds to communication from parents and guardians, and participates in department or school events as appropriate. Being visible and approachable helps families feel confident that their children are in a safe, supportive program.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation. The Assistant Track Coach follows all district and league regulations, maintains necessary certifications, and ensures that facilities and equipment are used appropriately. Emergency procedures are understood and practiced so that the team is prepared if an unexpected situation occurs.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the Assistant Track Coach at Kristie Pearson allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.

    <JobTitle>JV Head Coach Softball</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The JV Head Coach Softball position at Washington Unified Sch. Dist. is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the JV Head Coach Softball works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The JV Head Coach Softball at Washington Unified Sch. Dist. sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Washington Unified Sch. Dist., athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The JV Head Coach Softball encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The JV Head Coach Softball is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the JV Head Coach Softball position at Washington Unified Sch. Dist. is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobTitle>Varsity Assistant Softball Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Varsity Assistant Softball Coach position at Washington Unified Sch. Dist. provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the Varsity Assistant Softball Coach prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Washington Unified Sch. Dist., the Varsity Assistant Softball Coach works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The Varsity Assistant Softball Coach encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the Varsity Assistant Softball Coach at Washington Unified Sch. Dist. is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

The COACH, ASSISTANT - CHEER &amp; DRILL - MOUNTAIN CREST position at MOUNTAIN CREST HIGH SCHOOL provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the COACH, ASSISTANT - CHEER &amp; DRILL - MOUNTAIN CREST prepares practices that sequence learning effectively.

At MOUNTAIN CREST HIGH SCHOOL, the COACH, ASSISTANT - CHEER &amp; DRILL - MOUNTAIN CREST works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

    <JobTitle>Middle School Boys Basketball Head Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Middle School Boys Basketball Head Coach position at Risdon Middle School is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Middle School Boys Basketball Head Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Middle School Boys Basketball Head Coach at Risdon Middle School sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Risdon Middle School, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Middle School Boys Basketball Head Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Middle School Boys Basketball Head Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Middle School Boys Basketball Head Coach position at Risdon Middle School is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobDescription>
The Head Softball Coach - (25-26 School Year) at McClellan High School is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Head Softball Coach - (25-26 School Year) is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At McClellan High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Head Softball Coach - (25-26 School Year) helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Head Softball Coach - (25-26 School Year) works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at McClellan High School operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent McClellan High School with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Head Softball Coach - (25-26 School Year) reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Head Softball Coach - (25-26 School Year) role at McClellan High School.

    <JobTitle>Koret Swim Instructor &amp; Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Koret Swim Instructor &amp; Coach at University of San Francisco is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the Koret Swim Instructor &amp; Coach is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At University of San Francisco, the Koret Swim Instructor &amp; Coach helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter. When expectations are not met, the coach responds fairly, explaining consequences and encouraging athletes to learn from mistakes.

The position also requires responsiveness to student needs. Coaches remain aware of the emotional and academic pressures students face and adjust support accordingly. Checking in with athletes, acknowledging their efforts, and partnering with school staff all contribute to a positive experience. The Koret Swim Instructor &amp; Coach may assist in connecting students with resources when additional support is needed.

Outside of direct coaching, the role involves tasks such as coordinating with officials and opponents, assisting with scheduling, and managing team communication channels. The coach must be punctual, prepared, and detail‑oriented, ensuring that events run smoothly and that the team represents University of San Francisco well at home and away.

Safety remains an ongoing responsibility. The Koret Swim Instructor &amp; Coach follows district guidelines, maintains necessary certifications, and emphasizes proper warm‑up routines and technique to minimize risk of injury. This comprehensive approach to coaching allows student‑athletes to pursue their goals in a structured environment that prioritizes learning, well‑being, and long‑term success.

    <JobTitle>Wrestling, Assistant Coach - Boys/Girls - with Stipend</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Wrestling, Assistant Coach - Boys/Girls - with Stipend position at Wasatch Jr. High is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Wrestling, Assistant Coach - Boys/Girls - with Stipend works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At Wasatch Jr. High, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Wrestling, Assistant Coach - Boys/Girls - with Stipend encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies.

    <JobTitle>Head Coach - Football</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Head Coach - Football position at Horizon Middle School provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the Head Coach - Football prepares practices that sequence learning effectively.

The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Horizon Middle School, the Head Coach - Football works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job.

    <JobTitle>Middle School Cheer Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Middle School Cheer Coach at Jodi Pearson is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Middle School Cheer Coach is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Jodi Pearson, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Middle School Cheer Coach helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Middle School Cheer Coach works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Jodi Pearson operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Jodi Pearson with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Middle School Cheer Coach reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response. Maintaining appropriate certifications and staying current with best practices helps ensure that every training and competition environment is as safe as possible for all participants. Candidates who care deeply about student development, enjoy teaching the details of the sport, and are committed to a positive, educational approach to athletics will be strong fits for the Middle School Cheer Coach role at Jodi Pearson.

    <JobTitle>Track and Field Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Track and Field Coach role at Crittenden Middle School emphasizes collaboration, consistency, and long‑term program development. This position is ideal for a coach who enjoys working as part of a broader athletic staff and who values building connections across grade levels and teams. The goal is to help create a smooth pathway for student‑athletes as they progress, while maintaining a recognizable identity and standard of excellence for the program.

In practical terms, the Track and Field Coach coordinates closely with the athletic director and fellow coaches to align terminology, teaching priorities, and expectations. This might involve participating in coaching meetings, sharing practice plans, and adapting approaches so that athletes experience similar structures and messages at each level. At Crittenden Middle School, the program is strongest when coaches communicate and support one another.

Day‑to‑day responsibilities include designing practices that teach core skills, reinforcing team concepts, and preparing athletes for competition. The coach works to balance repetition with variety, ensuring that key fundamentals are constantly reinforced while athletes also experience new challenges. The Track and Field Coach reviews performance with the team, helping athletes learn how to analyze both successes and mistakes in a constructive way.

The role extends into community and family engagement. Coaches represent Crittenden Middle School at games, parent meetings, and potential youth outreach events. The Track and Field Coach may help host clinics or camps, encourage younger students to try the sport, and provide information about expectations to families who are new to the program. A welcoming, organized presence can greatly influence how the program is perceived.

Athlete support is ongoing. The Track and Field Coach monitors team morale, assists students in managing the demands of school and sport, and reinforces the importance of rest, nutrition, and healthy habits. The coach keeps the focus on sustainable growth rather than shortcuts, emphasizing that consistent effort over time leads to meaningful improvement.

Administrative tasks such as roster management, schedule communication, and equipment oversight are also part of the position. The Track and Field Coach must handle these responsibilities reliably, as they are essential to maintaining a well‑run program. Coaches who enjoy seeing the big picture, who are willing to share ideas, and who care about the experience of every athlete will thrive in this role at Crittenden Middle School.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach (100%)-NEMS-*Position available October 2025* (RR-142531)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach at Clarksville-Mongomery County is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Clarksville-Mongomery County reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Clarksville-Mongomery County. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Boys Lacrosse Assistant Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Boys Lacrosse Assistant Coach role at Wauwatosa West High School is focused on helping student‑athletes unlock their potential through intentional coaching, structured practice environments, and a strong emphasis on character. This description outlines a position in which the coach is expected to be a planner, a teacher, a mentor, and a positive representative of the school community. Successful candidates bring energy to practices, patience to instruction, and clarity to expectations.

Practices form the backbone of the program, and the Boys Lacrosse Assistant Coach is responsible for designing sessions that are purposeful and efficient. Each practice should have defined goals, from teaching new concepts to reinforcing previously learned skills or preparing for upcoming competition. The coach uses a variety of drills and teaching methods to keep athletes engaged, and regularly evaluates whether the team is progressing in the desired areas.

Coaches at Wauwatosa West High School are also trusted to guide student‑athletes through challenges.
