The Sports Medicine Physician (Temp) position at San Jose State University is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Sports Medicine Physician (Temp) works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program.

That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Club Women's Rugby Coach at University of San Francisco sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At University of San Francisco, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Club Women's Rugby Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

Program operations also fall under this role. The coach helps manage equipment, uniforms, and facilities, and assists with scheduling, transportation coordination, and adherence to league and district policies. The Club Women's Rugby Coach is expected to understand and follow all relevant regulations, including eligibility rules, sportsmanship guidelines, and safety standards, while maintaining current certifications such as CPR/First Aid as required by the district.

Finally, the Club Women's Rugby Coach position at University of San Francisco is a visible role that represents the school within the larger community. The coach interacts with families, officials, visiting teams, and youth programs, modeling professionalism in every setting. Candidates who are passionate about teaching, committed to student growth, and prepared to invest time and energy into the long‑term health of the program will find this role both challenging and rewarding.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Golf Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Golf Coach at University of California - Riverside is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Golf Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program.

    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach, Men's and Women's Track &amp; Field-Throws at Pomona College is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Coach, Men's and Women's Track &amp; Field-Throws plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement.

The Athletic Trainer at Feather River College is designed for a coach who believes that athletics is a powerful tool for teaching life skills. This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment. The program places a strong emphasis on clear communication, mutual respect, and long‑term development rather than short‑term results alone.

On a daily basis, the Athletic Trainer is responsible for planning and delivering practices that are active, safe, and inclusive. Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning. The coach provides direct instruction, demonstrates proper technique, and offers individualized feedback to help each athlete progress from their current skill level.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Feather River College, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The Athletic Trainer helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The Athletic Trainer works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible. Sharing information, attending department meetings, and contributing to school‑wide initiatives all help ensure that the program at Feather River College operates smoothly and consistently from season to season.

Game‑day responsibilities include preparing athletes physically and mentally, organizing lineups, communicating adjustments, and modeling composure in competitive situations. The coach is expected to represent Feather River College with professionalism toward officials, opponents, and fans. After competitions, the Athletic Trainer reviews performance with the team, highlighting effort, improvement, and areas for growth.

Health and safety are a constant priority. The coach follows district and state guidelines for equipment use, conditioning progressions, and emergency response.

This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Cheerleading Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Cheerleading Coach at Bruton High School is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

This role centers on developing student‑athletes as people first and competitors second, helping them learn responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork in a structured and supportive environment.

Training sessions should include a balance of fundamentals, decision‑making drills, and live or game‑like situations so that athletes are constantly learning.

In addition to technical coaching, this position carries significant mentoring responsibilities. At Emerald Ridge High School, coaches are expected to build positive relationships with student‑athletes and to support them through the challenges of school, competition, and adolescence. That means listening carefully, encouraging good choices, and reinforcing expectations related to attendance, academic effort, and personal conduct. The ASSISTANT COACH - FOOTBALL helps create a team environment where athletes feel valued and where they understand that their actions affect the group.

The role also includes collaboration with the broader athletic department. The ASSISTANT COACH - FOOTBALL works with the athletic director and other coaches to coordinate facility use, align program philosophies, and support multi‑sport participation when possible.

    <JobTitle>Volunteer Coaching</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Volunteer Coaching role at Sun Prairie Area is focused on building a competitive, well‑organized program that still prioritizes the overall well‑being of student‑athletes.

The successful candidate will bring a clear vision for how to teach the sport, how to manage a team, and how to represent the school in a positive and professional manner.

The coach monitors eligibility, encourages students to keep up with assignments, and celebrates academic milestones.

Program administration tasks include managing equipment and uniforms, tracking inventory, assisting with scheduling, and following all district and league regulations. The coach should be organized, punctual, and attentive to details such as transportation arrangements and roster paperwork.

    <JobTitle>Middle School Assistant Track Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Middle School Assistant Track Coach position at TCSD Schools is a key leadership role within the school's athletic program and wider learning community. This long-form description is designed to give prospective applicants a clear view of the expectations, responsibilities, and culture that surround the role. Coaches in this position are trusted to model character, support academic success, and help student‑athletes grow through meaningful experiences in practice, competition, and daily school life.

In this role, the Middle School Assistant Track Coach works closely with the athletic director, school administrators, and other coaches to design and maintain a structured, developmentally appropriate program. That includes planning practices that blend fundamental skill instruction, competitive drills, and situational teaching so athletes understand both the technical and strategic sides of the game. The coach is responsible for teaching core skills, reinforcing proper technique, and helping athletes safely build strength, conditioning, and sport‑specific endurance.

The position also focuses heavily on culture and leadership. The Middle School Assistant Track Coach at TCSD Schools sets the tone for effort, respect, and sportsmanship. This involves building clear expectations for behavior, guiding athletes through wins and losses with perspective, and maintaining standards that reflect the values of the school and community. Student‑athletes should come away from the program with improved confidence, stronger communication skills, and a better understanding of teamwork and accountability.

Another important part of the job is collaboration. The coach regularly communicates with teachers, counselors, and families to help student‑athletes balance athletics with academics and other responsibilities. At TCSD Schools, athletic participation is viewed as an extension of the classroom rather than a replacement for it. The Middle School Assistant Track Coach encourages students to stay organized, meet eligibility requirements, and pursue long‑term goals in the classroom as well as on the field or court.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Coach for Women's Softball</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Coach for Women's Softball position at Robert Harley provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the Assistant Coach for Women's Softball prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Robert Harley, the Assistant Coach for Women's Softball works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility.

Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The Assistant Coach for Women's Softball encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the Assistant Coach for Women's Softball at Robert Harley is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobTitle>Varsity Girls Cross Country</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Varsity Girls Cross Country at Ukiah Unified School District is a comprehensive coaching assignment where teaching, organization, and care for students come together in a single role. The coach is expected to be prepared, professional, and consistent, creating a framework in which athletes understand what is expected of them and feel supported in meeting those expectations. The program thrives when the coach brings a balanced focus on performance, safety, and personal development.

During practices, the Varsity Girls Cross Country manages time efficiently, moving athletes through warm‑ups, skill stations, team concepts, and competitive play. The coach provides instruction and feedback that is specific and actionable, helping athletes understand not just what to do, but why it matters. Attention is given to fundamentals, conditioning appropriate to the sport and season, and mental preparation for competition.

The position carries a strong responsibility for modeling behavior. At Ukiah Unified School District, coaches are role models whether they are on the sideline, traveling with the team, or speaking with families. The Varsity Girls Cross Country demonstrates composure, fairness, and respect, even in emotionally charged situations. Athletes observe and imitate these behaviors, so the coach’s example has a direct impact on team culture.

The role also involves building strong connections with the broader school community. The coach collaborates with staff members, responds to communication from parents and guardians, and participates in department or school events as appropriate. Being visible and approachable helps families feel confident that their children are in a safe, supportive program.

Safety and compliance requirements form an important foundation. The Varsity Girls Cross Country follows all district and league regulations, maintains necessary certifications, and ensures that facilities and equipment are used appropriately. Emergency procedures are understood and practiced so that the team is prepared if an unexpected situation occurs.

This position is well suited to coaches who are detail‑oriented, who enjoy planning and facilitating engaging practices, and who care about the long‑term lessons students take away from their time in athletics. Serving as the Varsity Girls Cross Country at Ukiah Unified School District allows a coach to influence not only competitive outcomes, but also the habits and character of the next generation.

    <JobTitle>Cheer Coach LAHS</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Cheer Coach LAHS position at Los Altos High School provides an opportunity to guide student‑athletes through an experience that combines challenge, support, and growth. This role is intended for coaches who see beyond wins and losses and who value the lasting impact that a positive athletic program can have on young people. Through careful planning, consistent expectations, and ongoing communication, the coach helps create a framework where athletes can thrive.

From an instructional perspective, the Cheer Coach LAHS prepares practices that sequence learning effectively. Early sessions may focus heavily on fundamentals and basic systems, while later practices refine execution and introduce more advanced concepts. The coach uses demonstrations, targeted drills, and guided scrimmages to help athletes apply what they learn. Regular assessment allows the coach to adjust plans based on the team’s progress.

The position also requires deliberate attention to team culture. At Los Altos High School, the Cheer Coach LAHS works to ensure that the environment is welcoming, fair, and focused on collective responsibility. The coach sets expectations around effort, communication, and respect, and follows through when those expectations are not met. Celebrating positive examples and giving athletes leadership opportunities strengthens the sense of ownership within the group.

Support for the broader student experience is built into the job. Coaches stay informed about academic calendars, test periods, and other school events so that practices and competitions are scheduled thoughtfully whenever possible. The Cheer Coach LAHS encourages athletes to communicate about conflicts in advance and to take initiative in managing their commitments. When students feel supported in both academics and athletics, they are more likely to remain engaged and successful.

Administrative responsibilities include coordination with the athletic department, assisting with transportation, submitting required paperwork, and maintaining accurate rosters. The coach must be attentive to detail and willing to complete these tasks reliably, as they directly affect the experience of athletes and families.

At its core, the Cheer Coach LAHS at Los Altos High School is a chance to teach, to mentor, and to build something that extends beyond a single season. Candidates who are motivated by the opportunity to help students grow through sport will find this position especially meaningful.

    <JobTitle>Assistant Softball Varsity Coach</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Assistant Softball Varsity Coach at Bassett Unified School District is a comprehensive coaching role that combines instruction, mentorship, and program management. This long‑form description reflects the multifaceted nature of school coaching, where the coach is both a technical expert and a caring adult presence in the lives of student‑athletes. The position is ideal for someone who values structure, communication, and collaboration while maintaining a clear focus on student development.

Day to day, the Assistant Softball Varsity Coach plans and leads practices that prioritize safety, learning, and steady improvement. A typical session might include dynamic warm‑ups, small‑group drills, competitive games, and review conversations that help athletes understand why they are working on certain skills. The coach explains expectations clearly, uses age‑appropriate language, and adapts instruction so that athletes at different experience levels can participate and progress.

Another key element of the job is fostering positive habits. Coaches at Bassett Unified School District reinforce punctuality, preparedness, and respectful communication. The Assistant Softball Varsity Coach expects athletes to bring the proper equipment, to listen when others are speaking, and to take responsibility for their effort and behavior. When mistakes occur, the coach responds with guidance and accountability rather than embarrassment, reinforcing that learning is an ongoing process.

The role also emphasizes alignment with the school’s mission. Athletics is treated as part of the educational program, not as a separate or higher priority. That means the Assistant Softball Varsity Coach supports academic expectations, respects teachers’ roles, and encourages athletes to manage their time effectively. By checking in on grades and reinforcing eligibility requirements, the coach helps students see the connection between their everyday decisions and their opportunities to compete.

Operationally, the position involves logistics such as coordinating with transportation, ensuring facilities are left in good condition, communicating schedules, and maintaining equipment inventories. The coach understands district policies, league rules, and safety procedures, and follows them consistently. Maintaining required certifications and participating in professional development keeps the coach informed about best practices in training and athlete welfare.

In addition, the Assistant Softball Varsity Coach may contribute to long‑term program building through youth clinics, off‑season activities, and collaboration with other levels of the program. By investing in relationships with families and younger athletes, the coach helps sustain interest and continuity in the sport at Bassett Unified School District. Candidates who enjoy balancing big‑picture planning with day‑to‑day teaching will find this position engaging and fulfilling.

    <JobTitle>Boys Basketball Coach (6th Grade)</JobTitle>
    <JobDescription>
The Boys Basketball Coach (6th Grade) at Lucille Whitehead Intermediate School is an integral member of the school's educational team, using athletics as a platform for teaching discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. This position calls for a coach who is organized, reflective, and committed to continuous improvement, both for themselves and for their athletes. The role blends hands‑on coaching with program administration and relationship‑building.

From a coaching standpoint, the Boys Basketball Coach (6th Grade) is responsible for teaching the rules, techniques, and strategies of the sport in a way that is accessible to student‑athletes. Practices are planned to include progressive skill work, position‑specific instruction, and opportunities for athletes to apply learning in controlled scrimmage situations. The coach pays attention to pacing and variety so that sessions remain engaging while still challenging students to stretch their comfort zones.

Culture is a central focus of this job. At Lucille Whitehead Intermediate School, the Boys Basketball Coach (6th Grade) helps create a team environment where respect, honesty, and effort are expected. The coach sets clear standards regarding communication, attendance, and sportsmanship, and works with athletes to understand why these standards matter. When expectations are not met, the coach responds fairly, explaining consequences and encouraging athletes to learn from mistakes.

The position also requires responsiveness to student needs. Coaches remain aware of the emotional and academic pressures students face and adjust support accordingly. Checking in with athletes, acknowledging their efforts, and partnering with school staff all contribute to a positive experience. The Boys Basketball Coach (6th Grade) may assist in connecting students with resources when additional support is needed.

Outside of direct coaching, the role involves tasks such as coordinating with officials and opponents, assisting with scheduling, and managing team communication channels. The coach must be punctual, prepared, and detail‑oriented, ensuring that events run smoothly and that the team represents Lucille Whitehead Intermediate School well at home and away.

Safety remains an ongoing responsibility. The Boys Basketball Coach (6th Grade) follows district guidelines, maintains necessary certifications, and emphasizes proper warm‑up routines and technique to minimize risk of injury. This comprehensive approach to coaching allows student‑athletes to pursue their goals in a structured environment that prioritizes learning, well‑being, and long‑term success.
